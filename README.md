# ⚙️ GearGuard

**GearGuard is a smart, Odoo-native maintenance management product** that transforms how organizations track assets, assign technicians, and control maintenance workflows.

Instead of scattered spreadsheets and manual follow‑ups, GearGuard delivers a **single source of truth** where equipment health, people, and processes stay perfectly connected.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Maintenance teams struggle with:

* No real-time visibility into asset health
* Manual task assignment and delays
* Disconnected equipment and repair history
* Poor reporting on failures and team workload

These gaps lead to **downtime, inefficiency, and costly mistakes**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: GearGuard

GearGuard introduces an **automated maintenance workflow** designed specifically for the **Odoo ecosystem**.

It connects:

* 🏭 **Physical Assets** (Equipment)
* 👨‍🔧 **Skilled Workforce** (Maintenance Teams)
* 🛠️ **Repair Workflows** (Maintenance Requests)

Every action updates the system intelligently — reducing human error and improving operational clarity.

### 🔹 Smart Maintenance Requests

## 🔄 How It Works

### 🔧 Reactive Maintenance (Breakdowns)

When equipment fails:

1. A maintenance request is raised
2. Selecting the equipment **auto-assigns the correct team**
3. Task moves through a visual pipeline:
   `New → In Progress → Repaired`
4. Technician logs repair duration

➡️ Faster response, zero manual routing.

---

### 🗓️ Preventive Maintenance (Planned)

For routine servicing:

* Maintenance tasks are scheduled in advance
* Managed through a **calendar-first interface**
* Managers instantly visualize monthly workload

➡️ Fewer breakdowns, better planning.

---

## 🤖 Automation That Thinks Ahead

### 🗑️ Scrap Protection Logic

If a repair is marked as **Scrap**:

* The linked equipment is automatically archived
* Prevents future usage or maintenance scheduling

➡️ Ensures safety, data integrity, and zero misuse.
